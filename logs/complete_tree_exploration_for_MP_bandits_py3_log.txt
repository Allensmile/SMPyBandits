Done for exploring every transitions up-to depth 1 for this root state:
    State : M = 2, K = 2 and t = 0, depth = 1.
[[ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]] =: S
[[ 0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.]] =: Stilde

    Using these policies:
  - Player #0/2 uses Selfish_KLUCB_Ubar (which is <function Selfish_KLUCB_Ubar at 0x7f1121ea19d8>)...
  - Player #1/2 uses Selfish_KLUCB_Ubar (which is <function Selfish_KLUCB_Ubar at 0x7f1121ea19d8>)...
    Using these arms:
  - Arm #0/2 has mean mu_1 ...
  - Arm #1/2 has mean mu_2 ...

There were 16 unique leafs for depth 1...
