OracleNotFair: initialized with 17 arms and 6 players ...
It decided to use this affectation of arms :
 - Player number 1 will always choose the arm number 15 ...
 - Player number 2 will always choose the arm number 16 ...
 - Player number 3 will always choose the arm number 12 ...
 - Player number 4 will always choose the arm number 14 ...
 - Player number 5 will always choose the arm number 11 ...
 - Player number 6 will always choose the arm number 13 ...

Number of players in the multi-players game: 6
Time horizon: 10000
Number of repetitions: 8
Using collision model: onlyUniqUserGetsReward
  Detail:  Simple collision model where only the players alone on one arm sample it and receive the reward.

    - This is the default collision model, cf. https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2065v3 collision model 1.
    - The numpy array 'choices' is increased according to the number of users who collided (it is NOT binary).
