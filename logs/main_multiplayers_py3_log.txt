Number of players in the multi-players game: 2
Time horizon: 20000
Number of repetitions: 20
Using collision model: onlyUniqUserGetsReward
  Detail:  Simple collision model where only the players alone on one arm sample it and receive the reward.

    - This is the default collision model, cf. https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2065v3 collision model 1.
    - The numpy array 'choices' is increased according to the number of users who collided (it is NOT binary).
    
Creating a new MAB problem ...
  Reading arms of this MAB problem from a dictionnary 'configuration' = {'params': [0.1, 0.5, 0.9], 'arm_type': <class 'Arms.Bernoulli.Bernoulli'>} ...

Final ranking for this environment #0 :
- Player #2, '#2<klUCB>'	was ranked	1 / 2 for this simulation (last rewards = 14756.6).
- Player #1, '#1<klUCB>'	was ranked	2 / 2 for this simulation (last rewards = 13139.3).
