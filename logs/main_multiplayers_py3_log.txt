Number of players in the multi-players game: 2
Time horizon: 20000
Number of repetitions: 20
Using collision model: onlyUniqUserGetsReward
  Detail:  Simple collision model where only the players alone on one arm sample it and receive the reward.

    - This is the default collision model, cf. https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2065v3 collision model 1.
    - The numpy array 'choices' is increased according to the number of users who collided (it is NOT binary).

Final ranking for this environment #0 :
- Player #1, '#1<rhoRand, Thompson, rank:1>'	was ranked	1 / 2 for this simulation (last rewards = 10011.9).
- Player #2, '#2<rhoRand, Thompson, rank:1>'	was ranked	2 / 2 for this simulation (last rewards = 9967.1).
