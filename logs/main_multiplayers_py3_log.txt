Number of players in the multi-players game: 2
Time horizon: 10000
Number of repetitions: 1
Using collision model: onlyUniqUserGetsReward
  Detail:  Simple collision model where only the players alone on one arm sample it and receive the reward.

    - This is the default collision model, cf. https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2065v3 collision model 1.
    - The numpy array 'choices' is increased according to the number of users who collided (it is NOT binary).
    
Creating a new MAB problem ...
  Reading arms of this MAB problem from a dictionnary 'configuration' = {'arm_type': <class 'Arms.Bernoulli.Bernoulli'>, 'params': [0.1, 0.9]} ...
 - with 'arm_type' = <class 'Arms.Bernoulli.Bernoulli'>
 - with 'params' = [0.1, 0.9]
 - with 'arms' = [B(0.1), B(0.9)]
 - with 'nbArms' = 2
 - with 'maxArm' = 0.9
Number of environments to try: 1

Evaluating environment: <MAB{'nbArms': 2, 'arms': [B(0.1), B(0.9)], 'maxArm': 0.90000000000000002}>

Giving the final ranks ...

Final ranking for this environment #0 :
- Player #1, '#1<Uniform>'	was ranked	1 / 2 for this simulation (last rewards = 2606).
- Player #2, '#2<Uniform>'	was ranked	2 / 2 for this simulation (last rewards = 2529).
