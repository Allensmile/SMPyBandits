Number of players in the multi-players game: 6
Time horizon: 5000
Number of repetitions: 4
Sampling rate DELTA_T_SAVE: 1
Using collision model: onlyUniqUserGetsReward
  Detail:  Simple collision model where only the players alone on one arm sample it and receive the reward.

    - This is the default collision model, cf. https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2065v3 collision model 1.
    - The numpy array 'choices' is increased according to the number of users who collided (it is NOT binary).
