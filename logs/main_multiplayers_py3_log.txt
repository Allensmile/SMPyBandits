Number of players in the multi-players game: 2
Time horizon: 10000
Number of repetitions: 4
Using collision model: onlyUniqUserGetsReward
  Detail:  Simple collision model where only the players alone on one arm sample it and receive the reward.

    - This is the default collision model, cf. https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2065v3 collision model 1.
    - The numpy array 'choices' is increased according to the number of users who collided (it is NOT binary).

Final ranking for this environment #0 :
- Player #2, '#2<Uniform>'	was ranked	1 / 2 for this simulation (last rewards = 3341.75).
- Player #1, '#1<Uniform>'	was ranked	2 / 2 for this simulation (last rewards = 3319.25).
