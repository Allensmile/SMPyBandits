Considering the list of players :
 [rhoRand(BayesUCB), rhoRand(BayesUCB), rhoRand(BayesUCB), rhoRand(BayesUCB)]
Number of players in the multi-players game: 4

Using collision model onlyUniqUserGetsReward (function <function onlyUniqUserGetsReward at 0x7f7fe1347620>).
More details:
 Simple collision model where only the players alone on one arm samples it and receives the reward.

    - This is the default collision model, cf. https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2065v3 collision model 1.
    - The numpy array 'choices' is increased according to the number of users who collided (it is NOT binary).

Using collision model onlyUniqUserGetsReward (function <function onlyUniqUserGetsReward at 0x7f7fe1347620>).
More details:
 Simple collision model where only the players alone on one arm samples it and receives the reward.

    - This is the default collision model, cf. https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2065v3 collision model 1.
    - The numpy array 'choices' is increased according to the number of users who collided (it is NOT binary).
