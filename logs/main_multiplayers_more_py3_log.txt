Considering the list of players :
 [rhoRand(Thompson), rhoRand(Thompson), rhoRand(Thompson)]
Number of players in the multi-players game: 3
Time horizon: 20000
Number of repetitions: 10
Sampling rate for saving, delta_t_save: 1
Sampling rate for plotting, delta_t_plot: 50
Number of jobs for parallelization: 4
Using collision model onlyUniqUserGetsReward (function <function onlyUniqUserGetsReward at 0x7f45174df620>).
More details:
 Simple collision model where only the players alone on one arm samples it and receives the reward.

    - This is the default collision model, cf. https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2065v3 collision model 1.
    - The numpy array 'choices' is increased according to the number of users who collided (it is NOT binary).

Number of players in the multi-players game: 3
Time horizon: 20000
Number of repetitions: 10

Sampling rate for plotting, delta_t_plot: 50
Number of jobs for parallelization: 4
Using collision model onlyUniqUserGetsReward (function <function onlyUniqUserGetsReward at 0x7f45174df620>).
More details:
 Simple collision model where only the players alone on one arm samples it and receives the reward.

    - This is the default collision model, cf. https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2065v3 collision model 1.
    - The numpy array 'choices' is increased according to the number of users who collided (it is NOT binary).
