Considering the list of players :
 [rhoRand(BayesUCB), rhoRand(BayesUCB), rhoRand(BayesUCB)]
Number of players in the multi-players game: 3
Time horizon: 10000
Number of repetitions: 50
Sampling rate for saving, delta_t_save: 1
Sampling rate for plotting, delta_t_plot: 1
Number of jobs for parallelization: 4
Using collision model: onlyUniqUserGetsReward
  Detail:  Simple collision model where only the players alone on one arm sample it and receive the reward.

    - This is the default collision model, cf. https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2065v3 collision model 1.
    - The numpy array 'choices' is increased according to the number of users who collided (it is NOT binary).

Considering the list of players :
 [rhoLearn(BayesUCB), rhoLearn(BayesUCB), rhoLearn(BayesUCB)]
Number of players in the multi-players game: 3
Time horizon: 10000
Number of repetitions: 50
Sampling rate for saving, delta_t_save: 1
Sampling rate for plotting, delta_t_plot: 1
Number of jobs for parallelization: 4
Using collision model: onlyUniqUserGetsReward
  Detail:  Simple collision model where only the players alone on one arm sample it and receive the reward.

    - This is the default collision model, cf. https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2065v3 collision model 1.
    - The numpy array 'choices' is increased according to the number of users who collided (it is NOT binary).
