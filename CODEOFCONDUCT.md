# AlgoBandits [Community Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/)

Our community members come from all walks of life and are all at different stages of their personal and professional journeys. To support everyone, we've prepared a short code of conduct. Our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment.

Towards this end, certain behaviors and practices will not be tolerated.

## TL;DR

- Be respectful.
- Abusive behavior is never tolerated.
- Violations of this code may result in swift and permanent expulsion from the AlgoBandits community channels.
