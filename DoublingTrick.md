# **Doubling Trick for Multi-Armed Bandits**
I studied what Doubling Trick can and can't do for multi-armed bandits, to obtain efficient anytime version of non-anytime optimal Multi-Armed Bandits algorithms.

- Remark: I wrote a small research article on that topic, it will be a better introduction as a small self-contained document to explain this idea and the algorithms. Reference: [[What the Doubling Trick Can or Can't Do for Multi-Armed Bandits, Lilian Besson and Emilie Kaufmann, 2018]](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-XXX), to be presented soon.

## Configuration:
A simple python file, [`configuration.py`](configuration.py), is used to import the [arm classes](Arms/), the [policy classes](Policies/) and define the problems and the experiments.

FIXME write this

For example, this will compare the classical MAB algorithms [`UCB`](Policies/UCB.py), [`Thompson`](Policies/Thompson.py), [`BayesUCB`](Policies/BayesUCB.py), [`klUCB`](Policies/klUCB.py) algorithms.

```python
configuration = {
    "horizon": 10000,    # Finite horizon of the simulation
    "repetitions": 100,  # number of repetitions
    "n_jobs": -1,        # Maximum number of cores for parallelization: use ALL your CPU
    "verbosity": 5,      # Verbosity for the joblib calls
    # Environment configuration, you can set up more than one.
    "environment": [
        {
            "arm_type": Bernoulli,  # Only Bernoulli is available as far as now
            "probabilities": [0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.1]
        }
    ],
    # Policies that should be simulated, and their parameters.
    "policies": [
        {"archtype": UCB, "params": {} },
        {"archtype": Thompson, "params": {} },
        {"archtype": klUCB, "params": {} },
        {"archtype": BayesUCB, "params": {} },
    ]
}
```

To add an aggregated bandit algorithm ([`Aggregator` class](Policies/Aggregator.py)), you can use this piece of code, to aggregate all the algorithms defined before and dynamically add it to `configuration`:
```python
current_policies = configuration["policies"]
configuration["policies"] = current_policies +
    [{  # Add one Aggregator policy, from all the policies defined above
        "archtype": Aggregator,
        "params": {
            "learningRate": 0.05,  # Tweak this if needed
            "updateAllChildren": True,
            "children": current_policies,
        },
    }]
```

The learning rate can be tuned automatically, by using the heuristic proposed by [[Bubeck and Cesa-Bianchi](http://sbubeck.com/SurveyBCB12.pdf), Theorem 4.2], without knowledge of the horizon, a decreasing learning rate `\eta_t = sqrt(log(N) / (t * K))`.

## [How to run the experiments ?](How_to_run_the_code.md)

You should use the provided [`Makefile`](Makefile) file to do this simply:
```bash
make install  # install the requirements ONLY ONCE
make comparing_doubling_algorithms   # run and log the main.py script
FIXME write this!
```

## Some illustrations
Here are some plots illustrating the performances of the different [policies](Policies/) implemented in this project, against various problems (with [`Bernoulli`](Arms/Bernoulli.py) arms only):
